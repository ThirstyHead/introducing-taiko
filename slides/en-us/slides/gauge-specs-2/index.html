            <p>User Journey tests in Gauge are comprised of two complementary parts -- Specifications, written in Markdown; and Tests, written in the programming language of your choice. (More on that in just a moment...)

            <p>
              Markdown is basically plain text with some simple decorators like hashes for headers (which represent the name of your specs) and asterisks for bullet items (which represent the individual steps to take). Markdown gives you the flexibility to express the steps in exactly the language your end user uses to describe them.
