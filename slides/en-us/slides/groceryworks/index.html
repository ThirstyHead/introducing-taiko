            <p>So, here's a website for a fictional grocery store called GroceryWorks. As you click around, you'll see that tapping the categories on the left show you different types of food items -- beans, nuts, pasta, produce, and so on. Clicking on a food item adds it to the cart on the right. Clicking on the food item again removes it from the cart. Clicking 'Purchase' allows you to place your order or cancel it.
