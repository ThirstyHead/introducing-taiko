This is why we're so excited about Taiko -- a free and open source browser automation tool. ThoughtWorkers have been building tools like this for over 15 years now. We want to make sure that you have modern, stable, easy-to-use tools for your developers, for your test suites, and for your Continuous Delivery pipelines.
