&gt; .api click

Fetches an element with the given selector, scrolls it 
   into view if needed, and then clicks in the center of 
   the element. If there's no element matching selector, 
   the method throws an error.

Example:
	click('Get Started')
	click(link('Get Started')) 

          </code></pre>

One of the most powerful features of Taiko is its selector logic. Whatever you (or your end users) see on the screen, you can use here in conjunction with the 'click' command.
