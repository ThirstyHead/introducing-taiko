      So, if you type in "goto('https://thirstyhead.com/groceryworks"), you'll visit the GroceryWorks website that we talked about just a moment ago.

Of course, this works just as well visiting 'localhost' on your development machine, or visiting the URL of your staging environment, your test server, or even your production website. It's completely up to you.
