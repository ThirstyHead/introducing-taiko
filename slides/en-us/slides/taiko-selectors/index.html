      Of course, if you need to be more specific, you can be. You can say, "Click on the image", or "Click on the link", or "Click on the listItem". Click on the screen element "toLeftOf", "toRightOf", "above", or "below". You can even use the familiar "$" to use class selectors or ID selectors if that's the level of specificity you need.

But believe it or not, the less specific you can make your Taiko scripts, the more resilient they'll be in the face of change. When you change that link to a button, or that checkBox to a comboBox, or that class name yet again, you'll be happy that you used the on-screen text instead of the underlying implementation.
