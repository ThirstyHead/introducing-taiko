       This is what's so exciting about the idea of "browser automation tools". WebDriver is a W3C standard that will soon be baked into every modern browser. 
            </p>
            <p>
       WebDriver allows you to remotely control your browser from a script -- visiting new web pages, filling in form fields, clicking on buttons, and so on.

Automated testing is an obvious use of this. Testing the behavior of your web app in an actual browser couldn't be easier. But it's not limited to simple testing -- you can grab screenshots at any step along the way, do sophisticated analytics like calculating download speeds and measuring time-to-interactive, and even verify how accessible your website is to folks with disabilities like low vision or lack of fine motor skills.

And notice the lead editor on this spec: Simon Stewart. As it turns out, Simon is a former ThoughtWorker who has been working on this kind of browser automation for over a decade.
